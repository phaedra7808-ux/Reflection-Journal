#1a-1 Virtualisation & Linux Setup
Setup Instructions
1.	Install VirtualBox or another virtualization tool.
2.	Download an Ubuntu ISO (Lubuntu or regular Ubuntu).
3.	Configure a new VM in VirtualBox with at least 2048 MB of memory.
4.	Boot the VM using the downloaded ISO and install Ubuntu.
5.	Configure network settings to allow bridged or NAT internet access.
6.	Reboot and confirm successful setup.

#Reflection Questions:
Q1: What challenges did you encounter during the virtual machine setup? ANS: The main challenge was resource contention, as sharing CPU and RAM with my host PC caused slow installation speeds. I also had to re-familiarize myself with the VirtualBox interface after a few years of using different tools like VMware.
Q2: What did you learn about virtualisation tools and their differences? ANS: I learned that Type 2 Hypervisors (like VirtualBox) run as applications on a host OS, whereas Type 1 Hypervisors run directly on hardware. Virtualization creates isolated environments, allowing for safe testing without affecting the main computer.
Q3: How confident do you feel using Ubuntu after completing this lab? ANS: I feel moderately confident. This lab served as a helpful refresher for navigating the Linux filesystem and using basic terminal commands, though I recognize that more practice is needed to master the command line.
Q4: In what ways can a virtualised Linux environment help in industry scenarios? ANS: It provides cost-efficiency and scalability, allowing businesses to run multiple servers on one physical machine. It also offers a "sandbox" for testing updates safely and enables rapid automation of server deployments.
Q5: What would you do differently if setting up another VM? ANS: I would implement Post-Install Snapshots to create recovery points before making system changes. I would also try a "Server" version of Ubuntu (no GUI) to reduce memory usage and better simulate a professional cloud environment.
