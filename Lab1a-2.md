# Reflection Questions
Q1: Which file editors are best for remote access and why? ANS: Nano is the best choice for remote access because it is lightweight and provides a visible shortcut menu. This makes it ideal for quick configuration changes over an SSH connection where a GUI is unavailable.

Q2: Compare software installation methods: SaaS vs binaries vs repos vs source. ANS: SaaS requires no local installation; Binaries are pre-compiled and ready to run; Repositories (like apt) manage updates and dependencies automatically; Source Code requires local compilation for maximum customization.

Q3: What are pros/cons of each method from user and developer perspectives? ANS: SaaS is effortless but requires internet. Repositories are highly secure and stable but may offer older versions. Source Code gives developers total control but is time-consuming for users to install and maintain.

Q4: How did using CLI improve your understanding of Linux? ANS: Using the CLI revealed that Linux treats almost everything—from hardware settings to software configs—as a simple text file. It allows for direct system interaction without the abstraction of a GUI.
