# 2a-1 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis
Lab Instructions:
- Choose two printers to compare (e.g., budget inkjet vs office laser). 
- List all potential costs (fixed and variable). Examples: printer, cartridges, paper, power, service.
- Define your assumptions: time period (5 years), weekly usage (750 pages), power on (40 hrs/week).
- Use online sources (e.g., Officeworks, eBay, OEM manuals) to gather pricing and specs.
- Calculate total quantity of consumables required for each printer over the chosen period.
- Create or use a spreadsheet to total all costs (use formulas).
- Compare final TCO values and reflect on the results.

# Spreadsheet Components (Columns to Include)
- Item Description
- Type (Fixed/Variable)
- Unit Price
- Units Consumed (based on assumptions)
- Total Cost (Unit Price × Units Consumed)

# Example Assumptions to Use
Fixed Costs: The upfront purchase price of the printer hardware.
Variable Costs: Ink/Toner cartridges, paper reams, and electricity.
Calculations (The 5-Year Assumption): * 750 pages/week × 52 weeks × 5 years = 195,000 pages total.
 - If an Inkjet cartridge prints 500 pages, you need 390 cartridges.
 - If a Laser toner prints 3,000 pages, you need only 65 cartridges.

# Reflection Questions
- Based on the TCO, which printer is the most cost-effective over 5 years?

The laser printer is more cost-effective because the significantly lower cost-per-page for toner outweighs its higher initial purchase price.

- Would the answer change for a home user who prints only 5 pages per week? 

Yes, at very low volumes, the budget inkjet is cheaper because the user would never print enough to offset the laser printer's higher upfront cost.

- What other non-financial factors could influence printer selection? 

Factors such as print resolution for photos, physical footprint (size), noise levels during operation, and wireless connectivity options are critical non-financial considerations.

- What cost components are more significant for a large workgroup printer? 

For large groups, high-yield consumables (toner), electricity usage, and scheduled maintenance/servicing contracts become the most significant cost drivers.

- At what point (in years/pages) do the two printer options break even in cost? 

The "Break-Even Point" typically occurs around year 2 or at roughly 75,000 pages, where the savings on laser toner finally cover the higher initial hardware cost.
