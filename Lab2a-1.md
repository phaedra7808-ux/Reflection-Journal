# Reflection Questions
- What’s the role of a firewall in managing services?

A firewall acts as a security gatekeeper by enforcing a "Least Privilege" policy to block unauthorized access to server ports.

- How did SSH access deepen your understanding of Linux as a server?

SSH demonstrates how servers are managed "headless" and remotely via an encrypted terminal rather than a physical monitor.

- Why is file compression important in server contexts?

Compression is essential for optimizing storage space, reducing backup sizes, and speeding up data transfers over a network.

- How does user privilege management help secure systems?

It secures the system by restricting administrative access, ensuring that only authorized users can modify critical system files.
